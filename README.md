#  III. Relevant codes 

The addition of tree controls in QT mainly refers to QtreeView related properties. 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309573731686
 ```  
As long as you make good use of the relevant properties of QtreeView, there should be no other difficulties in the future. There are two main points: 

1. When reading a point cloud, you need to display all point clouds. It is not necessary to display only a single point cloud at a time. Add the following to the reading place: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309573731686
 ```  
![avatar]( 255839389dd64f489267267ddff5724a.png) 

 In this way, each time the point cloud is read, the status is as follows, and the checkbox is in a ticked state:  

2. How to change the parameters and display through the checkbox 

By setting the slot function in treeview, each time the information changes in treeView will be linked to the parameters and the displayed changes. The code is as follows: 

 ```python

 ```  
Change the value of the cloud_index by whether it is currently checked. When cloud_index [i] == 0, it means not to display, and when cloud_index [i] == 1, it means to display.

Continuing with a chapter of qt + pcl point cloud reading, 1.1 point cloud reading display, today realizes the point cloud saving function of pcl. 

#  First, the core code 

In order to achieve fast saving and reading of point clouds, point cloud files are generally saved directly as binary files. For reference, point cloud reading and saving, this article saves them in PCDFileBinary and PLYFileBinary formats: 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309573733228
 ```  
#  QT Settings 

In the previous chapter, the saved menu bar has been created. Now you only need to add the slot function to save the point cloud. The code is as follows: 1) Add the slot function in the mainwindow.h file 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309573733228
 ```  
2) Add a specific implementation in mainwindow.cpp

 ```  
3) Add the connect connection to the initialization function, and at the same time, add the exit operation connect together 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 2024020309573733228

 Mainwindow.ui adds a widget widget, right-click to upgrade to QVTKWidget widget widget; to display the real-time properties and parameters of the point cloud, add two GroupBox widgets to the left of the QVTKWidget widget widget, and add textbrowser widgets to the groupbox respectively, with a grid layout; set the vertical layout of the two GroupBox widgets, and then lay them horizontally with QVTK, and set the ratio to 2:8. The final interface layout is as follows:

###  5. Add function functions 

At this time, the click read operation is invalid, so the signal and slot functions of qt need to be added. 

1) Add the slot function in the mainwindow.h file 

 ```python  
After clicking on the GitHub Sponsor button above, you will obtain access permissions to my private code repository ( https://github.com/slowlon/my_code_bar ) to view this blog code. By searching the code number of this blog, you can find the code you need, code number is: 202402030957375653
 ```  
2) Add the corresponding function implementation to the mainwindow.cpp file, which is mainly implemented to read pcd, ply, and txt format files. The code is as follows: The code for reading txt format is as described in 1.2 above:

#  IV. Conclusion 



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Continuing with the previous chapter, point cloud fixed sampling, this paper adds gridmin filtering, pcl-like :: Grid Minimum is to divide the three-dimensional point cloud into a grid in the X-Y plane, and then find the smallest z point cloud in each grid to represent the grid. If the grid does not have a point cloud, it will not generate a center point to represent the grid point cloud like pcl :: ApproximateVoxelGrid.
